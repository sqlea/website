Alex has been helping data professionals apply DevOps principles to relational database development and deployment since 2010. He’s most proud of helping SkyScanner develop the ability to deploy 95 times a day.

Originally for [Redgate](https://www.red-gate.com/ "redgate"), later for [DLM Consultants](http://www.dlmconsultants.com/ "DLM Consultants" ), Alex has worked with clients on every continent except Antarctica - so he's keen to meet anyone who researches penguins.
