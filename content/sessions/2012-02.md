19:10-19:40 Upgrading to SQL Server 2012 - Mark Broadbent

"Sooner or later your organization is going to want to upgrade some or all of its SQL Server estate.
The question is are YOU prepared and ready?
What is your upgrade path going to be, what are your options and how are you going to perform it? More importantly how do you ensure that your migration is successful? All these questions and more will be discussed and demonstrations given for SQL Server running on Windows Server Core and coverting your Mirrored databases to AlwaysOn Availability groups."

"Virtualisation seems to be around us everywhere these days, including within our SQL Server estates, yet for those without direct experience of it there can often be feelings of uncertainty or the unknown.  This session aims to cover why and how we might use SQL Server and virtualisation together successfully, along with the knowledge to help you confidently design, deploy and manage virtual SQL Server 2012 environments."
