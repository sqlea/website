### Session 1: Penny Coventry - Creating and Enhancing Access Web Apps
In this session, after a brief introduction on how to use Microsoft Access 2013 to build Microsoft SharePoint apps with a full SQL Server database, she will enhance the Access app, by directly connecting to the apps SQL Server database; thereby the app can be enhanced using several methods, such as, using Business Connectivity Services (BCS), Microsoft Visio 2013 and several Business Intelligence technologies. Although this session only includes no-code demonstrations, she will be discussing techniques that Business Analysts, SharePoint and SQL Server experts tend to use and will show that once the experts have completed their configuration, power users can quickly enhance Access Web Apps. Penny will highlight any limitations between using Office 365 or an on-premises installation of Microsoft SharePoint 2013.

### Session 2: Francois Souyri - BI Tools in Office 365
There has been a lot of noise about PowerBI since its beta over a year ago. Does it mean we have to developing bespoke reports soon ? What does it mean for my BI road map ?

This session will attempt to describe where Microsoft is leading us , which tools are revolutionising data acquisition and reporting and why it makes sense to follow this path.

In a live demo we will extract some data from a SharePoint site, visualise them meaningfully with PowerPivot, PowerView, PowerMap and finally publish them back to Office365 PowerBI and PowerQ&A to close the circle.

Registration will start from 6.30pm. Nibbles and refreshments will be provided.
