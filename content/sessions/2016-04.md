You've heard all the hype about Power BI. You've seen that Microsoft is a leader in the latest Gartner Magic Quadrant and read all the blog posts about cool new functionality. Things are certainly changing fast in the world of Power BI, but the big question is: is it any good? Can I use it? How is it different from the 'old', Excel-centric Power BI? How does this fit with what's planned for BI in SQL Server 2016? In this session you'll find answers to all of these questions, see some demos of the new Power BI, and by the end be able to make your mind up about whether Power BI is for you or not.
