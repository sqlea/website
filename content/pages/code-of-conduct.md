East Anglia SQL Server User Group (SQLEA) is committed to ensuring an enjoyable harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of age, gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We will not tolerate harassment (in any form) of conference attendees, sponsors, speakers, volunteers, organizers or venue staff. Inappropriate language or imagery of a sexual or divisive nature is prohibited at the event and any of its official functions and parties. Violation of these rules may result in an expulsion or permanent ban from the event at the discretion of the conference organizers. We reserve the right to amend the SQLEA Code of Conduct Policy without notice where we see necessary.
